        The insert function is recursive, but you can descend through the tree

        and using a while loop. You can do the same thing for the insert method.

        There are several different possibilities when it comes to delete:
        1) We're deleting a node that has no children
        2) We're deleting a node that has one child 
        3) We're deleting a node that has two children (and therefore need to rebalance the tree)

        We keep track of the parent node, because if we want to chop off a branch we're going to have to connect 
        the subnodes of the one we're deleting to the parent above it.

        We'll take the iterative approach again, and the start of the method
        is very similar to contains, since we have to find the node to delete it...
